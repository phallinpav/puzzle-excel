# puzzle-excel


**puzzle.xlsx** is a maze excel file. The code will always check from 1st sheet on that file

Execute Main class to see the maze being executed.

**Before execute the file**: edit `puzzle.xlsx` file before execute to see the maze is being solved.
(unsolzed maze can be found in 2nd sheet of the file, can copy delete all content in 1st sheet and just pass content from 2nd sheet to see how it will solve)

using different Solution in Main file could return different result.
Some of those solutions will mark shortest route from Start to End, while some will mark with each step.
( I forgot which is which (^_^'') )
